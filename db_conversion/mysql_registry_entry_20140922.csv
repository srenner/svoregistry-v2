I have owned the car since 1989. I believe it had a little over 10K miles on it. It has always been garage kept. Never seen rain or snow. The original owner stated that the car never saw rain or snow when I bought it from him. Only Mobil One Synthetic Oil has ever been used. The car has never been in an accident, never needed body repair. The panels are extremely straight and ding-free. There is no rust anywhere on the car. I have taken pictures of all the typical areas that these cars will start to show corrosion (around the rear hatch wells, rocker panels, sun roof and door bottoms). The removeable sunroof does not leak, nor do any of the window seals or hatch. The car has not been driven much in the last 5 years, only to local car shows during the warm months. The whole exhaust system has been upgraded. The main &amp; duals are made of 3"" lightweight stainless, completely mandrel-bent. The catalytic converter is a free-flow style which provides less back pressure for the turbo/ exhaust. I had a Center Force Racing clutch and heavy-duty cable installed in 2005. I also installed an HKS Pro Flow air intake system but still have the original stock air cleaner assembly. There has been a manual boost control module also installed under the hood. Shown attached to the front of the radiator is an auxiliary fan to keep the radiator cool. Other than those modifications, the car is stock. I have had the aluminum rims refinished and spin-polished to a bright finish. There is no plastic clear coating on these rims which will fade and peel. The slots in the rims as well as the lug wells have been blacked out with a powder coat finish. These have always been the best looking SVO rims I have seen. The tires have tons of tread on them, but are starting to show their age (2001). The drivers seat is showing a tiny bit of wear along the upper/ outer seam. Otherwise the interior is in excellent shape. No cracks on the dashboard, or any wear on the carpets, interior panels or headliner. The shifter knob is worn, but I have a brand new one in the box that will go with the car. The leather steering wheel cover is worn, but has been protecting the original wrap quite well. The stereo is an Alpine CD player/ tuner which needs to be replaced (discs will not eject). I do have the original AM/FM cassette stock radio. There is a custom speaker box fitted into the rear hatch area which holds two 8"" sub-woofers and two 6x9 speakers. The front dash speakers have also been upgraded with mid-range and tweeters. There are two power amplifiers mounted on the rear of the back seats. When the seats are folded back, the amplifiers are hidden. I have extra parts that will go with the car. My Dad worked for Borg Warner for a few years, so I took advantage and stocked-up on available parts. I have a brand new clutch (plate and rotor), four brand new brake rotors with four sets of pads, four brand new fuel injectors, four brand new coil springs and will even throw in two bottles of injection system cleaner. A custom car cover comes with, that's in good shape. I no longer have the time to pamper this car the way I used to. The car has always been respectfully driven and never beat on. It runs as strong as the day I bought it. If you would like any other specific pictures or details, do not hesitate to contact me. I have many more photos, but I can only upload 24. I will respond quickly. If you do not know too much about these cars but are interested, do a little research. These Mustangs were definitely a different breed. Fast, fun and race course ready! Great investment potential. Buyer will not be disappointed.<br />After receiving many questions about the spare parts which will come with the car, I've decided to list them here. Every part listed is new and in it's original box.<br />*Borg-Warner Front and Rear Brake Rotors (All Four)<br />*Borg-Warner Raybestos Front and Rear Brake Pad Sets (All Four)<br />*Borg-Warner Brake Shim Kit<br />*Borg-Warner Clutch Plate &amp; Bearing<br />*Borg-Warner Clutch Cover<br />*Borg-Warner BCA Clutch Bearing<br />*Borg-Warner Kool Wire Spark Plug Wire Set (All Four Wires)<br />*Borg-Warner Fan Control Module<br />*Borg-Warner Fuel Injectors (Four)<br />*Moog Front and Rear Coil Springs (All Four)<br />*Accel U-Groove Spark Plugs (Six)<br />*Ford Driver and Passenger Replacement Door Lock Tumblers (Black w/Key)</p>

I AM THE<br />ORIGINAL OWNER AND HAVE THE PINK SLIP. I DROVE THIS CAR OFF THE<br />SHOWROOM FLOOR AT WALKER BUERGE FORD IN NOVEMBER 1985. I DROVE<br />IT FOR MANY YEARS AND IT HAS SAT OUTSIDE FOR 6 YEARS NOT RUNNING.<br />THE LAST I DROVE IT WAS 2 YEARS AGO AND NOW IT NEEDS A NEW FUEL<br />PUMP. IT'S ALSO SAT UNDER A PINE TREE AND HAS SAP ON THE PAINT. THE<br />BODY IS IN OTHERWISE GOOD CONDITION EXCEPT FOR SOME RUSTING IN<br />THE PAINT ON THE BACK HATCH AND THERE IS A HOLE IN THE REAR SPOILER.<br />NOT GREAT TO LOOK AT, BUT COULD BE REPAINTED. NO DENTS. THE ENGINE<br />HAS 254757 MILES ON IT AND THE ENGINE WAS REBUILT, SHORTBLOCKED AT<br />150000 MILES. THE INTERIOR IS DECNT WITH THE VACARRO TYPE SEATS<br />REUPHOLSTERED YEARS AGO AND THERE ARE A FEW CRACKS IN THE SEATS.<br />MY DOG HAD TEARED THE LEATHER OFF THE STEERING WHEEL YEARS AGO<br />AND I PUT A COVER ON IT. I REPLACED THE SHIFTER WITH AN ORIGINAL<br />REPLACEMENT. THE RADIO WAS REPLACED AND DOESN'T WORK. THE AIR<br />CONDITIONER WAS DISCONNECTED AND DOES NOT WORK ALTHOUGH THE<br />FAN AND THE HEATER WORKED LAST I DROVE IT. THERE'S RUST ON SOME OF<br />THE ENGINE PARTS ON THE SURFACE AS THE PICTURES SHOW. THE TIRES<br />WERE FAIRLY NEW AND DON'T HAVE MANY MILES ON THEM ALTHOUGH THE<br />CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR A WHILE. NOT REGISTERED SINCE 2004. THIS<br />CAR COULD BE USED FOR PARTS OR WITH A LITTLE TLC, COULD BE BROUGHT<br />BACK TO CONDITION. IT WAS A FAST CAR AND HAD REALLY FLAT HANDELING.<br />A REAL BLAST TO DRIVE. THE BUYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING.<br />WHEN THE PAYMENT HAS CLEARED, I WILL MAIL THE TITLE VIA FEDEX AND<br />YOU CAN PICK UP THE CAR.</p>",1,photos/photo_1905.jpeg,0,34.13074960,-118.59438730,NULL,"2013-04-17 14:13:14"

If you know your Mustangs then you know how rare this model really is. Here's a little history of this<br />model taken from Wikepedia:<br />Ford began to make a major push forward with the Mustang in 1982, nearly completely re-inventing every aspect of the vehicle, which included putting a new<br />emphasis on the model's sporty nature. Just prior to this, in the fall of 1981, Ford decided to form a division that could oversee both the company's racing<br />program and the production of limited-edition, high performance street legal vehicles based on or taking technology from the race vehicles. Officially, the division<br />was called the Special Vehicle Operations Department, but the public came to know them as simply SVO (S-V-O). Tasked with developing something that was<br />both plainly American and competent to compete with entry-level European sports cars of the day, the team went to work on the new Mustang, deeming that it<br />was the most obvious choice as a platform basis for a high-performance vehicle. Still ultimately concerned with issues such as fuel consumption and emissions,<br />SVO engineers opted to pass over the venerable Boss 302 in lieu of an updated, turbocharged, and stronger version of Ford's 2.3 liter inline four, originally used<br />in the Pinto. Endowing the engine with an advanced, computer controlled fuel injection system and an intercooled turbocharger system helped push power output<br />to 175 horsepower, fairly high for the time. With fine tuning and the addition of a new water-cooling system, power output rose to 200 horsepower (149 kW) for<br />1986 (205 horsepower (153 kW) for 439 85.5 SVOs) In addition, a ""fuel grade"" switch was added to the dash, allowing the driver to adjust the vehicle's<br />performance level depending on if premium or standard grade fuel was being used. The vehicle's standard 5-speed manual transmission was updated as well,<br />eventually receiving revised gearing and a factory installed Hurst shifter to improve feel and quickness. Also the 1986 SVO had different aero shaped headlights.<br />These headlights were designed for the 1984 model, but regulations would not allow them for another two years. One of the major downfalls to the turbocharged<br />inline four was the lack of torque in comparison to the V8, which, in the eyes of former muscle car owners, was considered a severe disadvantage. In addition to<br />the advanced engine, the SVO featured several key modifications over the standard Mustang to help increase performance. The front suspension geometry was<br />modified, f 15:1 ratio power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system replaced the standard system, a limited slip, 3.45:1, 7.5"" Traction-Lok axle was added for<br />the first year of production (later models used a 3.73:1 ratio, 7.5"" axle), a new, ventilated four-wheel-disc braking system replaced the GT's disc/drum setup (a<br />first for the Fox platform), specially designed pedals were used to aid ""heel-and-toe"" shifting and a complete Koni suspension system featuring specially tuned<br />adjustable struts, shocks, and horizontal dampers replaced the setup used on the Mustang GT. Five-lug, 16 &times; 7 inch aluminum wheels wearing P225-50R16 VR<br />Goodyear Eagle ""Gatorback"" tires were standard as well (originally shod with German Goodyear NCT tires, and later Gatorbacks). The rear disc brakes, the five<br />lug hubs, the sixteen inch (406 mm) wheels, the quad-shock rear end, and the Konis were used on the SVO before any other Mustang. Interior features included<br />adjustable sport seats with lumbar supports, a leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, shift lever, and emergency brake handle, power windows, door locks and A/C<br />and a premium stereo system, options that weren't normally found on small American coupes. However, an optional Competition Prep package deleted many of<br />those features to save weight. The exterior had a unique front grill that was only used on the SVO line, and a biplane spoiler that was also unique to the SVO.<br />The car was originally registered to the Ford Motor Company and used as a demo model in '84 and '85. It was taken to different dealerships around Wisconsin<br />and was purchased by a private owner in '86. I have documentation and the registration papers to verify this. It has the original owners and operator manuals.<br />This car has NOT been raced, abused or modified.<br />Drivetrain: It has the original 2.3 Liter intercooled turbo with factory Hurst 5 speed transmission. It starts and runs great. Can be driven anywhere. It has the usual<br />turbo smoke when you kick it down. Does burn a bit of oil. Still has factory Koni adjustable struts and shocks. Tires are in fair condition.<br />Body: The body is totally rust free from top to bottom. There is a little rust starting on the bottom of the doors. The body has a few minor dents, dings and<br />scratches but nothing major. It is missing the passenger side front marker light assembly. The paint is original and faded on the topside but could be buffed out.<br />Interior: Glass, carpet, door panels and center console in very good condition. Dashboard cover is cracked. Needs headliner. Leather on steering wheel and shift<br />knob are cracked. Passenger and rear seats are in good shape. Drivers seat, leather is cracked in a few spots. Does not have a stereo. A.C. worked but needs<br />line replaced.<br />Basically the car could be left as is and used as a daily driver or could be easily restored. I bought it with the intentions or restoring it but don't have the time or<br />cash to do the car justice.

Comes with extra parts and accessories shown, including 2 rear spoilers - 1 from LX and 1 from a later GT, N.O.S. (NIB) Fog Lights with Marchal covers, SVO plug wires - plus various nuts, bolts, levers, buttons, switches, controls and trim pieces. 49,856 miles - located in Henderson, Nevada (Las Vegas).

The paint looks ok from 6-8 feet but there are a few dings nothing major.. No rust that I have seen but paint is not perfect. The car has cold a/c power windows/locks tilt,cloth int and less than 600 miles on new tires and 300 mile on rear brakes..I dont have time to finish car due to other projects.

This car has never been modified in any way. My 85.5 SVO is a prime example of a true all original show car. I am the second owner of the SVO, it has never seen rain or snow, and has always been kept in a climate controlled garage. It still has the original VR gator backs that are in great condition, no dry rot or cracking. The only things that have ever been done to the car is oil and filter changes, battery changes, and the A/C has been converted over to R134A. Everything works perfectly on the car and the car runs, drives, and shifts excellent, just like new. The interior is in perfect condition. The car has never been in an accident and has a perfect Autocheck report. I am very meticulous about the condition and maintenance of my cars, and this a truly a rare collectors item. If you are looking at these cars, then you know what is out there and you know how rare one like mine is. Here is a great opportunity to own a piece of automotive history, one that is un-touched and as it was when it rolled off the dealers lot back in 1985. It&rsquo;s hard to put a price on ORIGINALITY, you can buy a 4,000 to 6,000 SVO, and dump 10k-12k into it and have a really nice SVO, but it can not duplicate an ALL original car. Cars of the caliber mine is, are worth significantly more money, and don&rsquo;t come around very often. The values of these cars are increasing every year, and are very sought after. I am very picky, so I will point out a couple of paint flaws. There is a very light scuff/scrape on the passenger fender that was caused while parked in my garage by a storage container, I have never tried to buff it out, it is not a deep scratch and did not remove any paint. Other than that, the body is very straight. The rear Bi wing is in perfect condition, No sag. There is absolutely NO rust, body, or paint work on the car. The passenger seat was rarely sat in and the reat seat has never been sat in. The car under carrige is also clean and it was never undercoated. The car is also available for sale locally, so I reserve the right to end the auction early if the car is no longer available for sale. Please call me for any questions or if local, to come see the car in person. There are no disappointments in this car, bid to win! The winning buyer is responsible for shipping or pick up of car. I will work with the shipping company to arrange a pick up time. Car will not be released until funds have cleared. Payment is to be made via certified cashier check, bank wire, or cash in person, NO personal checks or scams. Please call me to discuss any details prior to auctions end. Full payment due withing 7 days of auctions end. Deposit of $500.00 made via paypal or bank wire within 24 hours of auctions end. I have a clean and clear Florida title in my name in hand. The car is currently registered and insured. CALL 813-363-1342.</p>",2,photos/photo_1829.jpeg,1,28.33611420,-82.27453070,NULL,"2013-04-12 17:15:23"

Always garaged, Looks &amp; drives great, No accidents, clear title in hand, Very clean interior, Well maintained. Ice cold 134 A/C conversion. New tires,New brakes /rotors, radiator, front strut inserts, alternator, exhaust with stainless tips, rear and dash speakers. Fifty one pages of maintenance records from the same owner and dealer. NO RUST REPAIRS EVER!!!! dependable as daily driver. This car was owned almost it's whole life by one person in N.C. who baby this SVO like no other. It is repainted with original 1E paint code with some pearl added to enhance look. 1985 was the lowest production of the three years and they only produced 158 cars in silver that year,with less than that in leather. It's rare!!! This car was repainted ONLY because the original paint was faded from age.The only damage on the car prior to paint was a small split on the front cover and a couple of dings that were repaired.It is very shiny with about 4 mil's of clear. There is a small stone paint chip at the front of the hood, a small ding in one door that's hardly noticeable and the drivers seat could use a little work. Everything on the dash works, and the windows and power locks all function inside the car. ,all the exterior lamps are in good condition with new headlights and inner park lights.The dash,headliner and steering wheel in great shape, the side spats and the by-wing is in good shape. I mention these things ,because if you know anything about SVO's, you know these things are hard to find and very expensive when you do find them. You will not have to spend another thousand dollars on little things to make this car look good. This is one of the most collectable fox body mustangs, and has won trophies in 3 out of 4 car shows that I have taken it to. I am an honest person and I can tell you that you will not be disappointed with this SVO.I have had SVO's with half the miles that could not stand with this car mechanically. I will answer all questions, but PLEASE, Do not waste my time if you CAN NOT buy this car!!!!!! The pictures tell it all. I also have the original window sticker/ owners manual/Koni strut tool.I am driving this car so miles could change from listed mileage.Thanks for looking, Joe, 410-422-5064 if you have questions. I do drive this car daily, so mileage is subject to change a little.THIS VEHICLE IS BEING SOLD LOCALLY, AND I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO END THIS LISTING AT ANYTIME.</p>",2,photos/photo_1849.jpeg,1,38.25067240,-75.29102560,NULL,"2014-05-06 13:55:45"

It is a northern car, which means it has been injected with under-coating after it was built. VERY RARE! I bought this car to give to my son about 9 months ago from a guy in New York and quickly replaced the axles with moser axles, axle bearings, rear brake calipers, brake pads &amp; rotors, front brake calipers &amp; brake pads, shocks(KYB) &amp; struts(Ultras),(still have Konis) Handles like a dream! Also, I installed an adjustable fuel pressure regulator, oil catch can, K&amp;N filter, and replaced throttle sensor, EGR valve, MAF, plugs, plug wires, distributor cap and rotor button, coil, battery, alternator, valve cover gasket, power steering pump, and fuel filter. I also installed a Pioneer HD stereo and installed HID Xenon lights! I paid $8500 for this gorgeous car, but can see that I have put a lot of extra money in this car because my son always wanted a nice svo, but he recently passed away, so it really hurts to see it sitting in my garage. I have all of the receipts to everything I have replaced or installed. I also have the original cast SVO wheels to go with it as well... Please ask any questions before bidding...</p>",0,photos/photo_1868.jpeg,1,35.76035750,-84.13574530,NULL,NULL
1869,1FABP28T6FF244598,NULL,1985.5,0,1C,Leather,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"2012-07-15 20:34:39",bfsl16701,Bradford,PA,USA,,8361,"<p>Up for auction is probably one of the rarest and nicest ultra low mileage examples of a 1985.5 Ford Mustang SVO! I am listing this car for my boss and it is from his private collection which he has decided to reduce in size. I will describe the car and provide any and all details to give the prospective buyer peice of mind with his or her purchase.</p>
<p>First of all, this car is a 1985.5 Ford Mustang SVO which is a very low production car (approximately 475 in the world of this year). The 1985.5 model is also arguably the most desirable because of its 205 horsepower(the highest in the production run, flush mounted headlamps, dual exhaust, and ultra low production numbers. The car is black and has only 8,300 original miles! The carfax is clean and the pedigree I am about to describe is second to none-detailing this car's past all the way back to the original order sheet and dealer buyer's order in 1985! The car has always been in a climate controlled environment and is all original. We have the original sales order, buyer's order, window sticker, KONI gas strut adjustment knob tool and instruction manual in the plastic sleeve, four sets of original keys, original dealer key tags, original owner's manual, as well as assorted original owner's information pertaining to the purchase of this car back in 1985. One could spend over four hours just reading and enjoying this rare literature on the car which will be given to the new owner in a large folder.</p>
<p>The condition of this beautiful car is literally that of showroom status! In fact, it sits in our Ford showroom right now next to new Shelby mustangs and it fits right in! Starting with the black finish, the gloss of the paint is phoenominal with a deep shine. The panels all fit very nicely and the rear unique bi wing has no sag and is in great shape. All the wheels are in excellent shape as well as the body mouldings, side spats, and chrome pieces. The glass is all original and is free of scratches or chips. The factory dual exhaust out the back of the car is bright and beautiful. The car does not have a sunroof but does have the leather interior option. Moving to the interior, the original SVO leather is absolutely perfect with no tears, smells, stains or anything! The carpets, headliner, interior trim panels, dash, are all as close to brand new as a 8000 mile SVO from 1985.5 should be! The car smells new inside and the leather hurst shift boot, knob, and leather wrapped wheel are in beautiful shape. All options in the car work perfectly including nice cold A/C, premium sound system, hi low octane switches, power windows, locks, and all lighting systems. The car has the original fog lamp covers that also come with the car as well as the locking lug nut tool! There is so much that comes with this car, it truly is like buying it brand new back in 1985!</p>
<p>Under the hood is the 2.3 turbo engine in show condition. The pictures speak for themselves, but ""clean under the hood"" is not a phrase that does this engine bay justice as this is about as good as it gets and as close to new as it gets. The car has a battery tender installed for its indoor storage and that, as well as the cover will come with the car. The tender can easily be removed and does not compromise any of the original wiring under the hood. The oil has always been changed twice a year. My boss put motorcraft oil in the car and a motorcraft filter on the car. All the paint work on the flat black parts and the engine itself are ultra clean. Everything works perfectly under the hood and this car runs, drives, handles, like a brand new 1985.5 Ford Mustang SVO. There are no noted deficiencies in this car at all and everything on the car functions flawlessly.</p>
<p>The car was equipped in 1985.5 with a security code alarm system installed by the selling dealership(have original receipt). This is simply a small keypad affixed to the center console that can have a four digit code entered into it to disable the igntition. Evidently these were popular on eighties sports cars! The new buyer will get the code and original documentation. Also, the car was rust proofed by the original dealer as well(again we have the dealer work order) and the car has the little FORD plastic plugs in blue on the inner body panels, i.e. rocker panels etc. This was again done right at the original dealer back in 1985 and was paid for by the original owner. I cannot stress how clean the underneath of this car is and in fact you could eat off from it! The original dual exhaust is still shiny and there is absolutely no rust on this car anywhere! For safety reasons, the tires were recently changed to brand new Bridgestone Fusion Z rated tires which are like new. For safety reasons as well, because my Boss would drive this car occasionally( like twice a year!) the factory steering shaft with the old rag joint was replaced with a Maximum Motorsport double u joint steering shaft($300.00 value). The old shaft will come with the car, however as you may know, these old shafts were prone to the original rag joint failing and in a car this rare and beautiful, my Boss did not want to chance it when driving it the few times he did.</p>
<p>This car has been driven only 8300 miles over the last 27 years and lovingly maintained by its owners. It is probably one of the lowest mile examples on the planet and is sure to continue to go up in value. My boss does not need to sell this car and is not interested in low ball, unrealistic offers or conversations. I will accept phone calls and if you are serious or need any question answered I can put you in touch with him providing the question is of a relevant nature and you are indeed a serious buyer. This car, while in stunning shape, is being sold AS-IS with no warranty expressed or implied. Shipping and transportation is the buyer's responsibility. A $1000.00 dollar non refundable PAY PAL deposit is due within 24 hours of winning the auction. The remainder of the balance is due either in cash, or certified bank check, or wire within 72 hours after the auction is won. We have clear title in hand on the car which will be released to the new owner once above mentioned funds are verified as cleared. This car is for sale through our dealership and if it sells this auction can be ended at any time.</p>
<p>If you want a truly beautiful ultra low mileage 1985.5 Ford Mustang SVO to either collect, show, or even enjoy on Sunday drives, this car envelopes all of the above and then some. Good luck bidding! Justin Watts Internet Manager 814-331-3141</p>

I have all paperwork from the factory to the current day. All the owners can be contacted and i have spoken with them. The was was bought with 4467 miles. I drove it home and parked it. The SVO does go out on very short trips just to keep everthing lubed and running. I dont know where to start with the discription on the car. I will say the car is in showroom new condition. The undercarrage was hand waxed buy the second owner. Being that the car was never used the undercarrage has no rusted bolts or anthing it is like new. This is a blast to drive but looking at it all the time makes it a very expensive peace of garage funiture at the moment. ok there is a better idea of the car</p><p>The undercarrage.</p><p>All factory markings and stickers are still on the car.They look like new. There is no wear on the suspension and the floorpan still has a wonderful look to it. The car has never seen the rain and has always been covered. All the brackets and bushings are in new condition being they have all been lubed and are not dried out after 24 years. The exaust has never been touched and mosture has gotten into the mufflers and rotted them out. I due have replacements but have not installed them to to changing anthing on the car. All the mounts are in new condition and the underside is a perfect survivor and ready for the show ring.</p><p>The engine bay</p><p>The engine bay has never been detailed but maintained to a very high standard. NO ENGINE CLEANER HAS EVER BEEN USED just wd-40 to clean and lubercate all fittings, hoses mostureize the wiring and so forth. The engine runs great and does not smoke at all. There are no oil leaks and all fluids have been changed on a bi year bassis. Oil was chanded 3 monthe ago and was always serviced. The transmission, rear end have all had fluids changed. The brake system was serviced in september of 2011 with the front flex hoses replaced due to age and the complete system bleed. The SVO still has its factory pads and rotors wich are im perfect condition. The master cylinder is in perfect condition and does not need replacement.</p><p>The engine was a new timing belt and waterpump, which was replaced due to age not wear. The raditor was replaced and i have the original one which i was going to have fixed and reintalled. One of the fins started to leak and as you know you cannot get a factory replacement anymore. All the plated parts are in like new condition showing no wear. The engine compartment is in concourse condition. The A/C is still r-12 and does need a recharge. I have the r-12 which comes with the car. The a/c was working last summer but age got to it.</p><p>The Body</p><p>This SVO has never had any body or paint work. You can see this is a factory paint job showing all the faults of the erorr. The paint has a new luster and has never seen a buffer or the likes of. This car was always in a garage and covered so no uv light got to it. There are no door dings or anthing on the body again this is a true 4690 mile car. The paint has been waxed and that is all. There are no imperfections in the bumpercovers from parking at all. All the body panals fit as they left the factory are they good well they are factory. The paint has not even worn off the hood stops or the rear hatch from rubbing. The doors are a perfect factory fit and the hood has not shifted like all mustangs that have been used. The body is a perfect survivor and the paint is outstanding. A true mustang SVO fan would love this car due to the correctness of it</p><p>The interior</p><p>There is not to much to say it is a 4690 mile interior. The interior is perfect as it left the factory. Every part has its original sheen and look to it. The seats carpet, plastic panals are factory perfect. Several years ago the headliner was replaced due to the factory glue letting go and the original materal was used to replace it. The job was done to a very high level. There is no wear and the speedo was never disconnected if you due a vin search you will see the milage is correct. Everthing is working in the dash and all lighting is working. The leather shifter, shifter boot and handbrake lever are in prestine condition.</p><p>THE SEALS</p><p>All the seals and gaskets are still supple and due not leak. all the seals have been treated and are like new condition. Nobody has ever replaced them just taken care of.</p><p>The Paperwork</p><p>I have alot of paperwork which shows the millage to be true. The current title is from the state of florida and the MILAGE IS MARKED 4467 MILES 04/26/2011 ACTUAL. I have copies of the past title, window sticker, factory order sheet from the dealership to ford. I have all the glove box stuff including the dealer plastic keys. There is a binder of paperwork on the car. This is one of the nicest original SVO to be on the market and i think there are 3 others with lower miles out there. This SVO won the mustang nationals a while back.</p><p>THE CAR SPEAKS FOR ITS SELF i am just trying to present it to a new owner. I am a private seller.</p><p>IF you have any questions you can email me and i will get back to you. If you have an offer let me know and i will see.</p>",0,photos/photo_1881.jpeg,1,40.71435280,-74.00597310,NULL,NULL

It has a 5 speed and has not been modified from the original factory. It has no rust at all.<br />It does need paint and interior. The tires are weather checked. I bought it with head cracked. So I pulled the motor and replaced all the parts including the head with new or rebuilt&nbsp;parts. It has new pistons and rings and bearings, oil pump and a roller cam.The clutch I replaced, and water pump, belts also both fuel pumps and filters. I was fixing it up to<br />keep and drive. I haven't started it yet. You need to finish by getting the engine running. I have fuel to the rail and spark but I don't have it running yet. I had it in my shop and<br />have no room for it and I.m not going to work in the snow to get it going. The battery is also new. I'm getting old and just don't want to screw with it. Just plan on doing alot of<br />prettying up and getting it running. You will have to tow it or trailer the car which is what I would do. There isn't many of these left and this one has alot of new parts in it. BUT<br />your buying it as is and it is also for sale here so it might sell here. You can call me 19135942478. Plan on working on it some and then getting about 22 to 32 miles to the gallon<br />according to the book. I think the horsepower is about 215 with the roller cam. It has a tear in the lower back bumper and some blinker lenses cracked or broken. Also the rear<br />hatch shocks need to be replaced. The dash cover is bad and the seats are dirty but not torn. It needs a head liner but I believe the door panels and all the side panels are okay.<br />The carpeting is dirty. The electric windows and door locks work okay. I don't know if the radio is original and I don't know if it works. The inside could be cleaned up and used<br />except for the dash pad and headliner they are crummy. I have fuel to the rail and spark. I had it firing one time but it got too cold for me, I also have a new under the hood noise<br />blanket. The wheels are fine and original. The exhaust is bent down some. I did that loading off the trailer. Have Fun Bidding<br />On Feb-03-11 at 06:02:34 PST, seller added the following information:<br />I forgot to list the car has factory air, power steering, power brakes and lumbar pump seats. It also has a switch that goes from regular to premium. I believe this car is the fully<br />loaded one and sold for 14000.00 plus in 1984 when the last gas crunch was. The young couple I bought it from parked to because the head cracked and they told me everything<br />worked when they parked it.</p>",0,photos/photo_1910.png,0,38.57223530,-94.87912940,NULL,NULL

This vehicle is in pristine shape. Car has been<br />repainted the factory color with the best paints. Professionally painted due to the typical<br />fading that occured with older Ford paints. The whole car is original otherwise with the<br />exception of the heater core which was replaced last year. This car has leather interior<br />in great shape, power everything that was offered (these cars came loaded with the only<br />options being sunroof and radio choice).<br />The SVO is one of a few cars that collectors are calling truely collectible late model<br />Fords. I bought this car two years ago and sadly have to sell because moving and don't<br />have the garage space. This car needs nothing and would drive anywhere. Car is a<br />Missouri car and has NO RUST at all on car. Looked a long time myself to find one this<br />nice.<br /><br />Stock these cars were faster than the GT of the day by far. Handling was from Koni<br />shocks and struts all around (stock) that were fully adjustable, 16"" 5 -lug wheels, special<br />upper and lower control arms and special rear suspension all STOCK from Ford. The<br />SVO was years ahead of its time in electronics, power and performance.<br />This car is a prime example of a car that you could drive to a car show and take 1st<br />place. Looking to sell to a person that will care and use the car for their pleasure.<br />Car has power steering, power brakes, power windows, power locks, 5-speed hurst<br />shifter with world class t-5 transmission, 4 cylinder turbocharged-intercooled 210 hp<br />engine, fuel select switch (allows to use regular fuel with lower boost), special articulated<br />leather seats with lumbar and bolsters.</p>",0,photos/photo_1911.jpeg,0,40.78843400,-74.13319880,NULL,NULL

Engine was freshened at 117,400 miles. Engine was stripped, cleaned and honed.

Last Fall I had the flywheel resurfaced and installed a new clutch, pressure plate and throw out bearing. The car runs well. The interior is driver quality. There is a small crack in the speaker part of the dash pad. The seam on the driver seat bottom is open.

All were<br />installed new, with less than 500 miles on it. The money invested in the rear is more than the opening bid for the car.<br />There is a new fuel tank, 190lph fuel pump, and sending unit.<br />New Koni shocks (red $$$$) in the rear.<br />Powerslot rotors.<br />Has the original 16 inch SVO wheels.<br />The motor runs well. The T5 shifts perfect (if you put in another shifter). The valve seals were redone recently.<br />There is minimal rust, and as far as I know, all of it has been treated with POR15. Solid car.<br />It was lightly sideswiped on the driver's side as seen in the pics.<br />Do not expect to drive this car home unless you come with your own seat and shifter! However, it will drive onto a trailer easily.<br />This car could be restored for the SVO lover. It would be a treasure trove of parts for the Fox Body people (5 lug axles f/r). Or just pull out that 4 banger and bolt<br />in a 351 or Mod Motor and go racing!<br />I will not part anything else off of this car. If you want a part off of it just buy the whole thing and part it yourself. It's cheap! There is a ton of money left in this<br />car.</p>",1,photos/photo_1924.jpeg,0,40.56053120,-74.14748460,NULL,"2013-04-22 21:24:35"

The car was totaled in 1989 and has sat in a friend's garage ever since.<br />His health deteriorated and it was determined he would never finish the car. After he bought the car he had it taken to a frame shop and it is now straight, we<br />have the reciept for this work as well as many of the other parts he bought for it. This car was wrecked once prior to being totaled as it has a new rear clip<br />installed. The rear qtrs were replaced including the floor to just behind the front seats. This is a rare car and is probably worth repairing although it would make a<br />great parts car for someone with a worn out SVO. The SVO is a very special car with many parts that are special only to this model. The 1985 1/2 model was<br />the most powerful[205 HP] and came with the 3.73 rearend which is present. This car also has the original Koni shocks all around. Think about all the SVO<br />specific parts, and they only have 32K miles on them! The turbo and the throttle body were taken while it was stored in the garage. The seats are nice but dirty,<br />the dash is nice except for a hole someone made for a wire to pass through in the speaker area. The gauges show no signs of fading as most of these cars do.

I have<br />reluctantly decided to sell this car only because I have Inherited a vehicle from my grandfather, which I have decided to make my priority and restore.<br />This Mustang truly deserves a home where it will be the center of attention. It is virtually impossible to go anywhere in this car without being complimented by<br />onlookers.<br />This car features beautiful 17&rdquo; polished aluminum American Racing &ldquo;Bullitt&rdquo; rims.

The paint is very good- there are absolutely no dents, dings, or scratches. The unique biplane spoiler is in exceptional condition- not at all sagging, cracked, or otherwise damaged.<br />The engine runs and performs flawlessly. The ignition coil, ignition wires, distributor cap, battery cables, alternator, power steering pump, and belts have all<br />been replaced in the last two years.

The only flaws are a 2-3inch scratch on the glove box<br />door and the leather steering wheel and shift knobs are slightly faded. Also, the windows were professionally tinted 2 years ago (to the Florida legal limit). The<br />rear window film has two scratched areas. (only on the film, the glass is all perfect). It still has the original AM/FM cassette stereo, which works well, but has<br />developed a static noise when adjusting the volume knob. All the gauges, lights, switches, power windows, locks, etc. work perfectly.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with the Mustang SVO, they were very much ahead of their time and had many features which seperated them from the rest of the<br />mustang herd.. They feature a 2.3 Liter 4 cylinder engine with an advanced, computer controlled fuel injection system and an intercooled turbocharger system.<br />In addition, a ""fuel grade"" switch was added to the dash, allowing the driver to adjust the vehicle's performance level depending on if premium or standard grade<br />fuel is being used. The vehicle's standard 5-speed manual transmission was updated as well, receiving revised gearing and a factory installed Hurst shifter to<br />improve feel and quickness.<br />In addition to the advanced engine, the SVO features several key modifications over the standard Mustang to help increase performance. The front suspension<br />geometry was modified, a 15:1 ratio power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system replaced the standard system, a limited slip, 3.45:1, 7.5"" Traction-Lok axle<br />was added, a new, ventilated four-wheel-disc braking system replaced the GT's disc/drum setup (a first for the Fox platform), specially designed pedals were<br />used to aid ""heel and toe"" shifting and a complete Koni suspension system featuring specially tuned adjustable struts, shocks, and horizontal dampers replaced<br />VIN: 1FABP28T3EF145400 | Get the Vehicle History Report<br />Warranty: Vehicle does NOT have an existing warranty<br />Title: Clear<br />Condition: Used<br />For sale by: Private seller<br />Features<br />Body type: Hatchback Engine: 4 Cylinder Exterior color: Silver<br />Transmission: Manual Fuel type: Gasoline Interior color: Gray<br />Disability equipped: --<br />Options<br />Cassette player<br />Power options<br />Power locks Power windows Air conditioningthe setup used on the Mustang GT.

This is a second owner vehicle. The miles on this are original. This was a California car. The nice<br />part about it being a California car is that it has no rust. The original owner moved to South Dakota several years ago but did not drive it much and it has remained rust free. He very much liked<br />the car and kept it original with no modi?cations. I know these cars can be modi?ed to become wickedly fast. To ?nd one that has yet to be modi?ed is nice. You can keep it stock or you can<br />modify it without having to try to ?gure out what has already been done to it and if what was done was done well. If you are one of those people who ?nd value in very nice stock high<br />performance from the factory car then this might be what you are looking for. If you want something that you can modify, the nice thing is that you know exactly what has been done to this one<br />so far, which is nothing. You can make the upgrades yourself safely. This is a very reliable daily driver car. From what I gather these SVO Mustangs were considered a fast car and an awesome<br />handling machine back when they came out. They have that classic look of the 80s Mustang with its own little di?erences. If you are looking for an SVO then you already know about them and<br />the performance engineering that went into them. This is a 4cyl turbo charged car that gets this down the road in the seven second 0-60 range. These cars were awesome for the SCCA Autocross<br />racers since they tend to handle like they are on rails. Ford even put the gas and brake pedals closer together then the normal mustangs so that you could heel/toe drive.

<p>1985 Ford Mustang SVO. Definately a mechanic's special, as seen in the included photos. The body needs new paint, but there is hardly any dents or dings evident in the body. The passenger front fender is new, it was put on the vehicle and not primed, so it has surface rust that needs to be<br />sanded off to get it ready to paint. The engine runs, needs new electrical and fluids to get it in drivable condition. All electrical works, including lights front and back, it needs new light housings in the front, but has all lights in rear.<br />The interior is shot. Needs to be gutted and completely redone. Car has sunroof.<br />Local pickup only, although if you arrange for shipping, I will meet the shipper at the car's location so it can be shipped to you. The car is not in immediate runnable condition, so it needs to be loaded on a trailer via a winch or<br />something of that nature in order to move it. If the electrical is check and cleaned and the battery and engine fluids are replaced, the car will start and run. It has a strong engine. The entire drive train is original. The only major<br />item which has been replaced on the car is the front passenger fender.<br />This would be a great parts car or a great project car. There is no major rust visible on the car. The floorpans are solid. The seats need to be recovered and the roof redone, but the carpet just needs a good cleaning.</p>",0,photos/photo_1941.jpeg,0,43.19047090,-112.34497730,NULL,NULL

VIN #1FABP28T5GF220648. Paint code is 2A Medium Canyon Red with the Grey cloth interior. Factory 4 cylinder turbocharged/intercooled engine with 5 speed manual transmission, 4 wheel disc brakes, Koni shocks, Hurst<br />shifter, Marchal fog lights, unique spoiler, front fascia, hood, wheel spats, interior and more all from the factory.<br />I purchased this car and picked it up in Georgia approximately 3 years ago with plans to do a restoration on it. It has been in storage since that time with only minor cleaning and changes done after purchase.<br />1 of only 83 known to be originally built in 1986 with the Competition Prep factory option. 1 of approximately 380 built in this color out of 3379 built in 1986. The car shows only 56,373 miles on the odometer and a AutoCheck history report backs up these numbers.<br />The car does not appear to have ever been in an accident and the body is extremely clean with only very minimal surface rust showing on the inside driver door seam and underneath of the hatch near the center. No rust on any of the exterior body panels. The paint is what I feel is still very nice<br />and shines pretty well. There are several small dings on the side of the vehicle and also the previous owner got several small dents in the fenders and hood when working underhood on the vehicle. They will be seen in the pictures. Front lights are all present but will need polishing to remove the<br />typical yellowing. The Marchal fog lights are there but without the covers. Wheel spats are in very good condition and all the thin strip side mouldings are present and in good shape.<br />All the harder to find specific SVO parts are present on the vehicle with the exception of the original wheels which are relatively easy to find for restoration of the stock look. Currently has mid 1990's Mustang GT wheels.<br />The interior is in pretty good condition overall. The seats have no major spots, rips or tears but have a couple small cigarette burn holes. The fuzzy dash panels are typical for their age and should be reflocked. The leather horn pad and steering wheel is in good condition showing some typical<br />wear.The Hurst shift boot and knob also in good condition with some minor cracking on the top of the knob. Door panels very nice and straight but there is some minor pulling away of the fabric at hockey stick style trim moulding on the passenger side. The dash pad is faded but straight and has<br />one crack/split about one inch long. Carpet and console in good condition with normal wear.<br />The previous owner had engine trouble with the car and installed a new Turbo shortblock purchased from Advance Auto Parts and a aftermarket turbo. The car is currently running but has a smoking problem when running, not just puffing at startup due to valve seals. Since it is a continuous<br />smoking problem when running I feel it is in the turbo setup since I have made sure it had fresh plugs, pvc, etc. as well as verifying good compression. Also please note that a previous owner has wired the cooling fan in direct to a toggle switch under the dash.<br />Because the car has been sitting for several years it will obviously need checking and/or updating of the brakes, suspension and other mechanical components as well as solving the smoking problem before being roadworthy.<br />I still have the State of Georgia title for the vehicle from when I purchased it which will be given to the winning bidder along with a bill of sale. And as stated by the current running condition of the vehicle, the car will need to be picked up at my location in Lake Orion, Michigan which is approximately<br />one hour north of Downtown Detroit.<br />Vehicle Information<br />VIN: 1FABP28T5GF220648 | Get the Vehicle History Report<br />Inspection: Order an independent inspection<br />Warranty: Vehicle does NOT have an existing warranty<br />Vehicle title: Clear<br />Condition: Used<br />For sale by: Private seller<br />Features<br />Body type: Hatchback Engine: 4 Cylinder Exterior color: Red<br />Transmission: Manual Fuel type: Gasoline Interior color: Gray<br />Disability equipped: --I have tried to describe the vehicle as best as possible, and feel as a whole this is a very nice SVO Mustang that needs some time, care and some money invested to have a desirable rare car.

<p>Here is a rare special edition Mustang that is a great collector, a 1986 Mustang SVO. The SVO (Special Vehicle Operations) was produced from 1984-1986 with a total production of less than 10,000 combined. This is one of only 3,382 built in 1986. It is powered by a turbocharged 2.3 liter inline four cylinder engine with a 5 speed manual transmission and factory installed Hurst shifter. This turbocharged four cylinder engine is pushing out 200 hp @ 5000 rpm and offers a suspension that is second to none. This car has never been damaged and the exterior finish is nearly flawless. It is all original just like it came from the dealer with only 60k miles. The interior is in mint condition from top to bottom. It is very obvious that this car has been babied its entire life. This was a one owner for 20 years and comes with the original sales invoice, original owners manual and original metal plate warranty I.D. card. There are also several maintenance repair receipts dating back to 1986. This is an excellent investment opportunity for you to own a very rare collector vehicle. This car runs and drives like new.</p>",0,photos/photo_1951.jpeg,1,33.83899770,-83.90073820,NULL,NULL

As far as I'm concerned, the engine runs as good as it did when new, the exhaust is upgraded to dual exhaust, it has pillar gauges for turbo, has a Sony stereo. The car is a 1984 and is not in showroom condition, but I believe that anyone would agree this car is in super condition, especially for its age. I pulled it our of my garage not too long ago and am using it to commute to work since my truck only gets about 14mpg. I want to sell it to buy a new honda or toyota. The SVO gets about 22mpg with a heavy foot, meaning that I like to drive it like its supposed to be driven.</p>",0,photos/photo_1953.jpeg,1,39.33311970,-82.98240190,NULL,NULL

<p>After a second energy crisis, most people believed that V8-powered cars were living on borrowed time. Nevertheless, the public again began clamoring for performance cars. Enter the 1984-1986 MUSTANG SVO, a GT with a European approach to performance.</p>
<p>From Ford literature &ndash; &ldquo;When Ford gave the slogan &lsquo;The machine speaks for itself&rsquo; to the SVO, it knew the turbo four banger would be a sophisticated, race-proven automobile for driving enthusiasts. All of its exterior modifications, from the dual rear wing to the hood scoop are all functional. The power delivery is smoother with next to no turbo lag. This car offers world-class performance and can rival the cornering ability of the Ferrari 308 and Porsche 944.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mustang SVO showed the world that with a sophisticated fuel injection system, turbo and intercooler, a 2.3 four-cylinder could make enough power to rival engines twice its size and still get 25 mpg.</p>
<p>2.3-Liter Turbo &ndash; Built a Ford&rsquo;s Lima, Ohio plant, the 2.3 liter single overhead-cam four put out 205 bhp and 240 lb-ft for the 1986 models.</p>
<p>Five-Speed Transmission &ndash; Marketed as a serious driver&rsquo;s car, the SVO was only available with a Borg-Warner T-5, 5-Speed, manual transmission and a Hurst short-throw shifter.<br />Suspension Upgrades &ndash; SVOs were upgraded with Koni adjustable gas pressurized shock absorbers, recalibrated coil springs, front and rear anti-roll bars and close-ratio power steering. This contributes to its outstanding handling.</p>
<p>Four-Wheel Discs &ndash; To ensure that SVO&rsquo;s could stop as quickly as they accerlate, they were all equipped with four-wheel disc brakes. This didn&rsquo;t become standard again on regular Mustangs until 1994.</p>
<p>Live Rear Axle &ndash; SVOs came with a 7.5-inch live rear axle with a Traction-Lok differential and quad rear shocks. 3.73 gears for the 1986 model.</p>
<p>Distinguishing Features &ndash; SVO variants can be distinguished from other &lsquo;Stangs by twin square headlights, rear wheel spats, grill-less front styling, functional hood scoop, bi-level deck-lid spoiler and unique taillight treatment.</p>
<p>Driver-Oriented Interior &ndash; Interior equipment includes an 8,000 rpm tachometer, multi-adjustable sport bucket seats, leather-rimmed steering wheel, plus power door locks, mirrors and windows. Its pedals are configured to allow heel and toe downshifting.</p>
<p>1986 was the third and final year of production for the famed Mustang SVO. This is a 3 owner car and the same owner the last 8 years. This Mustang SVO has a clean CAR-FAX history and was repainted approximately 10 years ago to the factory original color of Medium Canyon Red Metallic.</p>
<p>This car has excellent documentation including the FORD MUSTANG SVO Certificate; the original Bill of Sale dated 6-26-1986 and sold new at Lee Motor Co. in Wilson, NC; original 1986 Mustang Owner&rsquo;s Guide; Original 1986 Mustang Operating Guide; Original Owner&rsquo;s ID Card; Original Ford Pre-Recorded Cassette Designed for the Car; Original Brochure About Your KONI SHOCKs on Your Ford SVO; 1986 Mustang SVO statics; 1984-1986 Mustang SVO Brochure.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE - ORGINAL PARTS &ndash; For the purist who may want to return this Mustang SVO to original condition the following original parts go with the car.</p>
<p>- As shown, the car has a set of &rsquo;05 Mustang Bullet Wheels &ndash; the Original set of Wheels go with the car to the new owner.<br />- The original radio/cassette player goes with the car. Currently, a nice sounding Kenworth AM/FM stereo with CD player is installed.<br />- Original KONI shocks go with the car to the new owner.<br />- Original Springs go with the car to the new owner.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a very nice 1986 Mustang SVO. Foxbody Mustangs are becoming more popular than ever and this SVO was technologically ahead of his time back in the day. The car has plenty of power and shifts through the gears with ease. As noted, the car has been repainted some 10 years ago and has some paint chips on the hood and sides. The A/C blows ice cold; power steering, power brakes and power windows all work as expected. The interior presents well and white gauge overlays have been installed. We noted that the power locks are not working. Given the vehicle age the mileage is Exempt; however, the odometer is showing 79,668. The speedometer was replaced by the past owner due to the cable not working and actual miles are unknown.</p>",0,photos/photo_1960.jpeg,1,34.98542750,-80.54951120,NULL,NULL

After I purchased the car, I took it to a Ford Dealership that specializes in Mustangs (Packey Webb Ford in Downers Grove, Illinois) and they looked the entire car over and performed a world class inspection. The only thing that had to be replaced was the air vein meter. I also had the air conditioning converted to R134. This car absolutely runs like a new car. Absolutely everything on the car works, and works like new. The interior is absolutely flawless. The exterior is equally flawless except for a small rock chip near the very front of the hood which I touched up with touch up paint. The only additional items I added to the car was I had the car rust proofed by Ziebart to forever protect the absolutely 100% rust free condition of this car, I added the top of the line Ravelco car alarm (at a cost of $450) and I had the LoJack system installed to assure the car will never get away (at a cost of $1,000).</p>",0,photos/photo_1972.jpeg,0,41.87811360,-87.62979820,NULL,"2012-09-19 23:15:41"

<p>Up for auction is one of the rarest of the ""rare"" Ford Mustang SVO's. This is the rarest year, in the rarest color and one of only 3 documented, surviving, Hertz Rent A Car SVO's that I know of. This is the only Hertz SVO restored to this level that I am aware of. There were about ten thousand SVO Mustangs produced over a three year period from 1984 to 1986. Of that number, only 37 of them were produced in this Dark Sage Green, paint code 4E. In 1985, Hertz purchased approximately 40 SVO Mustangs to be made available as rentals to their High Performance class customers. This car is truly a rare beauty.</p>
<p>In 1999, the car was restored to ""Concours-Driven"" condition, and remains in near-concours condition to this day. In April 2001, this car was featured in Mustang Monthly Magazine. The article documents some of the car's history and comments on how hard it was to restore a car of this vintage back then. Now, many of the NOS parts that were available then are simply, near-impossible to find. This car may be the only one of its kind, in this condition.</p>
<p>Over the years the car has aged gracefully. Some things that were incorrect in the car's original restoration have been made right, and the car runs as beautifully as it looks. I'd drive this car anywhere with full confidence! It's been garage kept since it's restoration in 1999, and continues to earn trophies wherever it goes. Not only does the car's condition deserve recognition, but its unusual color is a conversation starter even for those who don't know what the car is.</p>
<p>I've had the car for the last six years, and its time for me to move on. This car is being advertised exclusively on eBay for the length of this auction. I'm offering a ""Buy-it-now"" option for those who may want to scoop this car up quickly, and I won't reveal the reserve price, so please don't ask. I have a limited number of photos in this ad, so if you need to see any other part of the car not visualized in these photos, please ask and I will do my best to accommodate any requests.</p>
<p>I will require a $1,000.00 non-refundable deposit at the end of the auction, and full payment within 7 days of the end of auction. The car is being sold ""AS-IS, WHERE IS"". I will include with the sale of the car what documentation I have for it. No warranties expressed or implied. The purchaser will be responsible for pick-up and shipment. I am willing to assist the purchaser within reasonable limits. The car resides here in eastern Pennsylvania.</p>

It does smoke slightly on startup and I believe the turbo is working well and the boost gauge is moving.

As you can hopefully see in the photos the paint on this car is exceptional. Paint is around five years old. It<br />looks this good still because of high quality material, exceptional body and paint preparation, meticulous maintenance and constantly garaged. When I received the car it was overall<br />pretty solid just needed some freshening. Entire car was repainted including door jams with the exception of the engine compartment. Car has also been lowered with Eibach sport<br />springs. Handles great, much more than I dare to push the limit to.<br />If you are unfamiliar with this model, I encourage you to research it first before bidding. I am not listing everything that was unique about this vehicle from the standard mustangs.<br />This car has been pretty much-stored full time for the last three years due to a transmission problem with the factory T-5. I ran it periodically and drove it short distances to keep things<br />lubricated but not driven frequently or even regularly. I have too many vehicles and am finally tired of caring for them all. I replaced the T-5 with a T-5 World class (V-8 model) and a<br />Centerforce Dual Friction clutch. This was done last week. I have also recently replaced all four brake calipers and brakes and tires.<br />Interior is good condition but reupholstery would need to be done to be pristine. Look at pictures to see the major issues with the interior. The cloth on the drivers side upper bolster is<br />worn through (not pictured). The dash pad is cracked. There is a small cutout (about 3x8 inches) in the left interior quarter trim. I think previous owner may have had a CD changer<br />mounted there?<br />Runs good, AC has been converted to 134 refrigerant and works well. I think there might be a valve seal that is leaking because sometimes on start up there is a momentary puff of<br />smoke emitted. This seems to be dependent on where valve position sits once engine is shut off because it doesn't do it all the time. I have an additional cylinder head that can go with<br />the car if desired. It isn't rebuilt, but that it why I bought it. I have the original air intake assembly and original shifter handle also.</p>",0,photos/photo_1983.jpeg,0,39.32098010,-111.09373110,64.139.93.225,"2012-08-22 19:29:32"

Unfortunately, it has been parted out in the past so there is not a lot left in the interior or engine bay. The car was originally black. I think the body is in pretty good shape. The rear hatch was taken off and replaced with a black rusty one. I believe someone had a V8 in it at one point. The underside of the hood was cut to accomodate an air filter. The bottom of the radiator support is twisted. I think this happened from pulling it from that location. I think it would make a great car for someone who has a complete car that is rusty or perhaps make a track car. Someone had put an 8.8 in it. I do not know the ratio. It includes a dissassembled turbo coupe motor. I think most of the motor is there. I already have 3 SVOs, 85 GT T-top and 1 65 fastback project so I don't want to add this to my stack. The VIN is 1FABP28T9EF128990. This car will sit outside in my back half acre. I hope someone can use it. I am asking $400 for the car and the parts. I would be willing to trade for some SBF performance heads or ignition. Also need a passenger door for my 85 T-TOP Gt. Any questions give me a call. I can possibly help with delivery within a reasonable distance. It does have a title.</p>",0,photos/photo_1989.jpeg,0,47.67322810,-117.23937480,64.139.93.225,"2012-08-22 20:57:00"

<p>THIS IS A CAR I PURCHASED IN JUNE OF 05&rsquo; AND IS EXTREMELY CLEAN. IT SHOULD BE KEPT INSIDE AND ONLY DRIVEN ON NICE DAYS OR TO CAR SHOWS. THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN OTHER MUSTANG SVO CARS TO THIS ONE. THIS CAR IS IMMACULATE. SVO&rsquo;S WERE MADE FOR ONLY 3 YEARS AND WERE WAY BEFORE THEIR TIME. IF YOU&rsquo;VE NEVER DRIVEN ONE YOU WOULDN&rsquo;T KNOW ABOUT ITS HANDLING, COMFORT, AND POWER.</p>
<p>THIS SVO IS CLASSIFIED BY FORD AS AN 85 &frac12; MODEL. THERE WERE ONLY 9844 CARS SOLD DURING ITS PRODUCTION YEARS. 4508 IN 1984, 1515 IN 1985, 439 IN 1985 &frac12; MODEL, AND 3382 CARS IN 1986 ITS LAST YEAR. I WAS TOLD BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER THAT THE VIN MADE THIS CAR NUMBER 438. I HAVE A CERTIFICATE THAT SHOWS IT WAS BUILT ON THE LAST DAY OF PRODUCTION. HE HAD OWNED THE CAR FOR 5 YEARS. SOME MAY WONDER WHY FORD PHASED THEM OUT BUT AT THAT TIME THE MUSTANG GT WAS SEVERAL THOUSANDS CHEAPER AND PEOPLE DIDN&rsquo;T REALIZE AND WANT TO PAY FOR THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SVO VERSUS ITS SLOWER AND POORER HANDLING COUSIN THE GT. TECHNOLOGY COSTS MONEY. THE 84 AND 85 SVO&rsquo;S HAD ABOUT 145 HP WHERE THE 85 &frac12; HAD 205 HP AND 86 WAS DROPED BACK TO 200HP WHICH MAKES IT REALLY QUICK AND FUN TO DRIVE</p>
<p>I HAVE THEN PUT IN LARGER FUEL INJECTORS AND FUEL PUMP, COLD AIR INDUCTION, A BOOST CONTROLLER TO TURN UP THE BOOST ON THE TURBO, A FRONT MOUNT INTERCOOLER FROM STINGER, A 3&rdquo; DOWNPIPE FROM THE TURBO, A CUSTOM MANDREL BENT 2 &frac12;&rdquo; EXHAUST, AND A SPEC STAGE 1 CLUTCH. I HAVE NOT PUT THE CAR ON A DYNO, BUT BELIEVE WE ADDED AT LEAST 75 HP WITH THE UPGRADES.</p>
<p>THIS CAR IS IN SHOW CONDITION. I HAVE YET TO SEE AN SVO THAT WOULD COME CLOSE TO THE CONDITION OF THIS CAR. DON&rsquo;T BE FOOLED BY THE OTHERS, AS THEY TEND TO BE FULL OF BODY DAMAGE, BAD PAINT, AND NOT-SO-GOOD INTERIOR. THIS CAR HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.</p>
<p>THE EXTERIOR CONDITION IS EXCELLENT. IT HAS BEEN PAINTED ITS ORIGINAL COLOR 2R JALAPENO RED. IT IS A RUST FREE CAR AND HAS NEVER BEEN WRECKED. THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR APPEARS TO HAVE A VERY SLIGHT PARKING LOT DOOR DING, BUT NO SCRATCH IN THE PAINT, SO NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED. I BELIEVE THIS CAR HAS SPENT MOST OF ITS LIFE IN TEXAS. THE PAINT IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND HAS NEW WEATHER STRIPS, HEADLIGHTS, PARKLIGHTS, TAILLIGHTS, AND HEADLINER. THE INTERIOR IS LIKE NEW. IT HAS WEAR ON THE LEATHER GEAR SHIFT KNOB DUE TO IT DRYING OUT. THE CAR HAS ICE COLD A/C WHICH HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO 134A.</p>
<p>I JUST PUT NEW RUBBER ON THE REAR OF THE CAR. I HAVE 3 OF THE GOODYEAR VR50 EAGLE BACKS WHICH WERE THE SAME SERIES TIRE WHICH IT ROLLED OFF THE SHOWROOM FLOOR WITH. I DO NOT HAVE A FOURTH TIRE BUT YOU COULD FIND ANOTHER IF YOU WANTED TO PUT THE ORIGINAL BRAND TIRES ON THE CAR. THESE TIRES ARE IN GREAT SHAPE.</p>
<p>A COUPLE OF MINOR PAINT STONE CHIPS ON THE FRONT AND THE SHIFTER KNOB AND THE DOOR DING ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT I KNOW OF ON THE CAR THAT MIGHT NEED ATTENTION TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS A VERY NICE CAR.</p>",1,photos/photo_2001.jpeg,0,42.43114640,-83.48326920,64.139.93.225,"2013-04-17 14:37:00"

VIN: 1FABP28T8FF244599 It is really clean with only 36,000 miles. Runs great, handles great, no smoke. World Class T5 transmission shifts smooth and sure. Nearly new Dunlop Direzza Sport Z1 Star Spec Extreme Performance tires, Koni struts and period correct Borla stainless steel exhaust. Except for poly bushings and a 100 amp alternator, it is all stock. It looks great but is not a trailer queen. It had new paint when I bought it three years ago that has some blems. The leather is very good with some wear on the driver's bolster. The AC was charged when I got it with Freeze 12 and still blows really cold. I would like to get $8,500 for it, which I think is fair for such a good SVO. Email me at wlkariz@aol.com or call 602-448-8334.<br />Note: Now have new car in the garage, the SVO will have to go...

<p>UP FOR AUCTION IS A RARE 1986 FORD MUSTANG SVO. THIS IS ONE OF 338 THAT WERE PAINTED DARK GRAY METALLIC OUT OF A TOTAL PRODUCTION RUN OF JUST 3,320 CARS FOR 1986. THIS CAR HAS BEEN STORED FOR MANY YEARS AND IS IN EXCELLENT<br />OVERALL CONDITION. I PURCHASED THIS CAR FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND HAVE NOW DECIDED THAT I HAVE ONE TOO MANY TOYS SO ITS TIME FOR IT TO GO. THE CARS PAINT IS NEAR PERFECT AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE<br />IN THE CARS 23 YEARS OF EXISTANCE IT WAS TREATED TO A PROFESSIONAL RESPRAY. ALL SEALS WERE REPLACED AND THE ONLY ISSUES WITH THE BODY ARE A SMALL DING ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NICKLE ON THE PASSENGER UPPER QUARTER PANEL AND ON<br />THE CORNER OF THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR BUMPER COVER WHERE IT HAS A FEW SMALL SCRATCHES. THAT'S IT-THE BODY IS NEARLY FLAWLESS AND SO IS THE PAINT! THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR IS ALSO GRAY AND HAS LEATHER SEATS, NEW CARPET AND<br />HEADLINER AND DOOR PANELS. THE DASH IS ALMOST PERFECT WITH ONE SMALL CRACK ON THE DRIVER CORNER NEXT TO THE DASH GAUGES. THE STEERING WHEEL IS COVERED WITH A WRAP AND THE LEATHER UNDERNEATH HAS DETERIORATED AND WILL<br />NEED TO BE REPLACED. EVERYTHING IN THE CAR WORKS, POWER WINDOWS AND LOCKS, A/C, AM/FM CASSETTE RADIO(ORIGINAL) ALONG WITH ALL OTHER ACCESSORIES. UNDER THE HOOD THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT IS REALLY CLEAN AND SHOWS VERY<br />LITTLE WEAR. THE ODOMETER READS APPROX. 31,424 BUT I AM NOT CERTAIN IF THIS IS THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL MILES OFR NOT-I CANNOT VERIFY THIS. THE RADIATOR HAS BEEN REPLACED ALONG WITH ALL OF THE BELTS AND TIMING BELT. THE CAR ALSO HAS<br />FOUR RELATIVELY NEW DUNLOP TIRES ON IT AND ALL OF THE KONI SHOCKS AND STRUTS ARE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. IT ALSO HAS THE STAINLESS DUAL EXHAUST TIPS ON IT. THIS CAR HAS SAT IN A CLIMATE CONTROLLED GARAGE FOR AT LEAST THE LAST<br />FIVE YEARS AND BEFORE THAT WAS STORED ELSEWHERE IN A CLIMATE CONTROLLED BUILDING. THE ONLY MECHANICAL ISSUE THAT I KNOW OF WITH THE CAR IS THAT THE THROW-OUT BEARING MAKES A RATTLE NOISE WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AND IDLING. IF<br />YOU PUSH THE CLUTCH PEDAL IN THE NOISE GOES AWAY. THE CAR RUNS AND DRIVES EXCELLENT AND HANDLES VERY WELL FOR A 23 YEAR OLD CAR. I HAVE THE CLEAR TITLE FOR THE CAR AND IT IS READY TO GO. THE CAR CAN BE VIEWED BY APPOINTMENT<br />AND IF OTHER PHOTOS ARE NEEDED I CAN EMAIL THEM TO YOU. THIS CAR IS ALSO FOR SALE LOCALLY, SO I RESERVE THE RIGHTS TO END THIS AUCTION EARLY. THE CAR IS LOCATED IN KEMAH/LEAGUE CITY, TX. APPROX. 20 MILES SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN<br />HOUSTON, TX. PICK UP OR SHIPPING IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PURCHASER AND MUST BE DONE WITHIN SEVEN DAYS FROM THE END OF THE AUCTION.

<p>Original owner selling this collectable, 24 years old and still looks brand NEW. The 2.3 Liter Turbo Charger with 200hp still runs great... recently relocated and drove it from Chicago to Raleigh with no problems! New front brakes, new fuel pump, new gas tank and liner. All installed to get this car ready for sale. It is ready, be the lucky new owner of this completly original rare racer! Always garage kept, never driven in snow rarely in rain, professionally stored since new during winter months. Goodyear Gatorbacks have only 2k miles on them. The car still smells new! Small paint chip in front, no dents anywhere! small tear in steering wheel leather from use (can be fixed) headliner is slightly loose from age. Otherwise this this is perfect. Runs very very strong! The Overall Package: In addition to the advanced engine, the SVO featured several key modifications over the standard Mustang to help increase performance. The front suspension geometry was modified, 15:1 ratio power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system replaced the standard system, a limited slip, 3.45:1, 7.5"" Traction-Lok axle was added for the first year of production (later models used a 3.73:1 ratio, 7.5"" axle), a new, ventilated four-wheel-disc braking system replaced the GT's disc/drum setup (a first for the Fox platform), specially designed pedals were used to aid ""heel-and-toe"" shifting and a complete Koni suspension system featuring specially tuned adjustable struts, shocks, and horizontal dampers replaced the setup used on the Mustang GT. Five-lug, 16 &times; 7 inch aluminum wheels wearing P225-50R16 VR Goodyear Eagle ""Gatorback"" tires were standard as well (originally shod with German Goodyear NCT tires, and later Gatorbacks). The rear disc brakes, the five lug hubs, the sixteen inch (406 mm) wheels, the quad-shock rear end (early 84 units used a solid steel traction bar with a rubber cover), and the Konis were used on the SVO before any other Mustang.Interior features included adjustable sport seats with lumbar supports, a leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, shift lever, and emergency brake handle, power windows, door locks and A/C and a premium stereo system, options that weren't normally found on small American coupes. However, an optional Competition Prep package deleted many of those features to save weight. The exterior had a unique front grill that was only used on the SVO line, and a biplane spoiler that was also unique to the SVO. The Mustang SVO was the brainchild of the development team at Ford SVO (Special Vehicle Operations). While the SVO was only produced for 3 short years, it has been said ""The SVO was the best handling Mustang produced"". In 1986 3382 SVOs were built bringing the three year total to 9844 units.</p>",0,photos/photo_2090.jpeg,0,35.77209600,-78.63861450,65.28.65.51,"2012-08-27 00:43:04"

At the time the car had some minor body damage to the lr quarter panel and front end however no structural damage, so it was decided to completely replace the entire front clip (hood, nosepiece, nosepiece reinforcement, and both fenders) as well as the lr quarter panel. All parts were professionally removed at the spot welds with no cutting and all new original Ford NOS sheet metal was purchased. The front clip was installed however the owner never got around to the rear quarter. The car has since been sitting in dry storage since 1990. This is a project car that someone with the ability and time can put back together and make a nice car of. All body parts are there to reassemble, he even purchased every support bracket and new inner and outer wheel houses new from Ford. The engine and trans are still in the car. Interior was removed and wrapped in plastic and comes with the car. The original 7.5 differential has been removed and replaced with a 2004 Mustang 8.8 with disc brakes. In addition there is an NOS 2.3 engine block still in the plastic, NOS headlights and side markers, 4 slightly used original Goodyear Gatorback tires, and many other miscellaneous SVO parts.

<p>I got this car in early 2006 with the intention of gradually restoring it. I am pursuing a second college degree and don't have the resources to see that plan through now, so here it it is for sale. It is an early production ""slapper bar""car built sometime prior to December 1983 when the traction bars were dropped in favor of quad shocks on the rear suspension.<br />First and foremost, it starts, runs, drives, and I have a clean title for it. It is one of about 9,800 SVOs ever built. It is on a current non-op registration, so there are no back fees stacking up. It will need to be smogged before you can get tags for it. Mileage is an estimate.</p>
<p>Engine:</p>
<p>Runs well, compression around 145-155psi on all cylinders, better performing E6SE turbo manifold and water cooled stock replacement T3 turbocharger. Exhaust was replaced at some point and I think the muffler is a Magnaflow or Dynomax. There is mild tone to the exhaust, but it is not loud at all. Valve seals have maybe 1000mi on them. The thermal fan switch does not work, so the fan doesn't come on. The fan controller is in fine shape and has never burned itself up nor the wiring. The A/C compressor was locked up when I bought the car and it still is, so the A/C doesn't work. The heater core leaks and has been bypassed; I have a new core that is included with sale of the car. A new timing belt and tensioner is also included. The battery is old and does not hold a charge for very long.</p>
<p>Body:</p>
<p>The paint is showing some age from desert sun exposure and could stand to be rubbed-out at the least. Some paint is cracking on the hood around the passenger headlight. Some urethane is showng through on the rear bumper cover. Some of the door trim is missing. Most of the paint has faded off of the mirrors. The tires are dry and cracked. The passenger rear is flat in the photos because the valve stem broke off while I was washing the car. I put another wheel on in the interim and the original is in the hatch. I just wanted to show that I have all four original wheels.</p>
<p>Interior:</p>
<p>Carpet has a spot here and there. The passenger front and rear bench seat is in pretty good shape. The driver's seat needs to be reupholstered. The dash pad has typical cracking, especially around the speaker grates. The fuzzy dash sections are in good shape. The steering wheel needs to be recovered. Plastic panels in the hatch are so-so and the hatch carpet is weak from sunlight. Spare tire is still present and good, although the tire iron and jack are missing.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be as complete as possible, but this is an old car, and I'm sure I'm missing something.</p>

Underside of car is rust free other than typical surface rust on rear end housing due to being from California. Headliner was replaced so is not sagging.</p>
<p>Dash has a dash cap installed and painted to match interior due to cracked dash from California sun.

Shift knob is Ford Motorsport but look just like SVO just says Ford instead of Hurst symbol. Shifter boot original SVO in great condition. The rubber along top of doors could be replaced as it is the original and brittle due to California sun and 28 years old. Carpet in great shape as are seats. A/C needs charged but did work a couple years ago. Paint in very good shape there are some minor scratches here and there. Fuel tank and pump are newer.

<p>I bought the car with hopes of someone using this rust free chassis to save an SVO that is rusted. You will need to have another SVO for needed parts but this is the perfect donor recipient. The people I bought this from used parts from it to save other SVO's so saving one more would be great. The car comes without fenders, hood, interior or the correct 5 lug rear axle but as noted, if you have a rusted SVO you can simply place parts from the rusted chassis into this one and have a nice car.

Purists may not appreciate the subtle changes, but she will no longer be out-gunned by the many new turbocharged 4 cyclinders out there. Most changes: Recently built motor (less than 350 miles), with new pistons, rings, bearings, high flow oil pump, ported head w/oversized valves, ported intake-gutted top half, larger throttlebody, new/larger turbo, Bob's big log exhaust manifold, 3"" exhaust from turbo (with high flow catalytic converter), custom highflow intercooler,engine shocks, stage 1 clutch/throw-out bearing, 55 lb injectors and Racetech fuel/ignition computer. Turbo control switch now controls an electronic adjustible boost controller. AFR guage is in place, so that you can be sure your ratio is good. Front-end has been lowered approx. 1 inch, with a new front-end alignment. Tires are in pretty good shape (Pep Boys). New brakes, rotors and calipers - front and rear. There are replacement (correct) brake light covers, and a new front-end header (she has had a couple of ""taps""). Original intake, throttle body, exhaust manifold, intercooler, &amp; correct size turbo could be available (negotiable). She could use some bodywork on the doors and roof, plus a new shot of paint (5 plus year old Maaco paint job currently-original color was light gray), as there is a little rust or paint bubble poking through in various places. Driver's door needs an adjustment. Undercarriage is sound, though. There is a spare rim, with a new tire mounted. Rims could use a freshening up. Interior head-liner is not stock material (but I have some). Sunroof is nice, but is aftermarket. Shocks and infamous lower control arms have been updated with Ebay found low mileage units. Driver side front seat is worn, passenger side is in great shape and rear is nice. There is a spare rear seat bottom available for material to fix the driver's seat. Hatch supports are tired and hold when they want. Carpet is in pretty good shape (but could use a cleaning). Vehicle mileage is approximate, as I may drive it around before the listing ends.</p>",0,photos/photo_2210.jpeg,1,39.68372260,-75.74965720,24.31.244.131,"2013-04-09 00:44:13"

This '86 had the hilbilly mechanic treatment done to it before Dana bought it. Many of the underhood wiring connections were made with house wiring spec wire nuts. The air box was replaced with a K&amp;N cone type(good) and the VAM was then loosely attached to the car with plumbers strapping(bad). The cam cover and various pieces under the hood were 'freshened up' with bright blue spray paint with little masking. The alternator had been replaced with a unit that only had a single v-bely pulley. The '86 leather seats were missing and some other seats installed instead, I think they were T-Bird seats.

<p>From the seller:</p>
<p>""I purchased the car in New Mexico last year where it was in storage for 18 years. I have since rebuilt the engine and head to stock specs. I also put a new clutch and flywheel as well as a new gas tank, fuel pump and lines. I have all the receipts. The motor has less than 15 miles on it. The car runs and drives nice and turbo pulls like it should. This is a completely rust and dent free car as it has spent most of its life in the dry west. All outside trim is there and in good condition. The VIN is etched on all the windows and the wheels from hertz. The previous owner did do a quick paint job of charcoal on the exterior but it is thin and he didn&rsquo;t prep or prime the car because you can see the sage green where the paint is chipped. As for the interior, most of it is in good shape except driver&rsquo;s seat bolster, dash pad, and center console lid. All inexpensive!! The rest will need a shampoo and will clean up nice. Everything works on this car except a/c. I put new lines and will need a charge. Today I pulled the latch from the hood and the lever pulled out on the front of the hood and for the life of me I don&rsquo;t know how it goes back so you can close the hood but it won&rsquo;t lock shut. I will try and figure this out tomorrow. Also I will be putting in a new radiator as there is a pinhole that I noticed today. The underside of the car is solid as new.""</p>",0,photos/photo_2226.jpeg,1,40.85843160,-73.09955390,64.139.93.225,"2013-04-16 21:09:12"

<p>Text from ad:</p>
<p>This is a very original SVO which had the same owner since 1992. The car does run and drive but has been sitting since the year 2000 so it will need some work to be considered a daily driver. I bought the car with the intention of restoring it but haven't had the time to devote to it. Here's some more detailed information. The car did not pass the strict California emissions test therefore the car cannot be sold to a resident of the state of California, NO EXCEPTIONS!. BIDDING IS OPEN ONLY TO NON-CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.</p>
<p>Mechanical: As stated the car does run and drive. I have driven the car on a handfull of occassions and here is what I've observed. The engine starts easily and runs well. There is no smoking, knocking, overheating or odd noises. The car will occassionally hesitate on acceleration. I don't know if this is an issue with the turbo or something else. Turbo does kick in and work. The 5 speed trans will sometimes grind going into 2nd gear. If you don't shift too quickly it works fine. It will grind if you try to downshift into 2nd at a high speed. Transmission and clutch work fine other than the 2nd gear issue. Cooling fan doesn't seem to work. I never let the temp go higher than half way but the fan didn't come on at that point. Front end will need some attention. Noisy going over bumps. Brakes work fine. The tires look good but I'm sure they are quite old.</p>
<p>Exterior: The body and paint look good. There are no dents or rust on the body. The paint on the front bumper is scraped. The winshield has a large crack and will need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Interior: Interior is pretty nice for the age. Seats are good shape with no tears. Dash is solid with no cracks. The car has a sunroof which leaks and has damaged the front section of the headliner. Overall a nice interior.</p>",1,,1,37.77492950,-122.41941550,64.139.93.225,"2013-04-16 21:17:08"

I purchased the car in 2005 from a young engineer at Ford who had bought the car in 1994 from Arizona where it originally came from according to the window sticker. He then registered the car in Michigan (this is where his parents lived). Over the next 11 years he spent over $11,000.00 on NOS parts and restoration of the exterior, body and braking system of the car and only drove the car about 1000 miles. The car has been restored on the outside and is a 10 out of a 10. Every molding and light have been replaced on the car with NOS parts. The body had no rust to start with, the underside of the car has very minor rust staining on some of the seams. The interior of the car is a 9 1/2 out of a 10. Who ever buys this car - if you want it to be a complete restoration, all you will need to buy is a NOS shifter knob which will run around $200.00 on E-Bay. The engine runs good, the clutch is new and I just replaced the battery with a new one. The car does have the proper Good year Gator Back size and style tires which are impossible to get anymore - they are brand new and have not seen the road. The car also still has the Koni shocks on it. This car just needs the engine and engine compartment detailed to make it a complete restoration. The documentation that will come with the car consists of the original window sticker, the build sheet and the owners manual as well as some receipts for miscellaneous parts that the previous owner bought. This car is perfect for the person who wants to do an SVO restoration but does not want to go throught the aggrevation of dealing with the body work or getting the NOS parts (which are expensive and almost impossible to get). The reason I am selling this car is so that I can concentrate on the restoration of the 46 mile 1986 SVO that I bought (see Mustang Monthly Magazine September 2006 - ""The car that doesn't exist"").</p>",0,photos/photo_2234.jpeg,1,42.61836750,-82.53101800,64.139.93.225,"2013-04-26 20:52:14"

<p>This Stock 1984 Mustang SVO is in GREAT overall condition. This car spent most of it's life in North Carolina so I doubt you will find a cleaner Mustang SVO. The car was re-painted and both the motor and clutch were rebuilt in 2008 by a previous owner. The paint is in great shape with no paint fade what so ever. The car runs extremely strong and currently builds 16 PSI through a stock rebuilt turbo. The undercarriage of the vehicle is in mint condition and contains NO RUST. The car has a solid body and the weather stripping, steering wheel and dash board cover were replaced two years ago. THE only sign of rust on the car is a small &ldquo;Quarter Size&rdquo; spot of surface rust under the rear hatch. The tires, wheels, headliner and rear spoiler are in excellent condition. This vehicle features the factory sunroof and the inside of the sunroof frame is rust free. You can see from the pictures that the interior is all original and in great shape. I have owned the car for the past two years and put approximately 800 miles on the car. I routinely attend car shows during the summer months and take it back and forth to work on occasion. Late last year I did notice that the gas gauge does seem to be a bit off so I re-fuel when the gas gauge hits a quarter of a tank.</p>",0,photos/photo_2235.jpeg,1,42.51445660,-83.01465260,64.139.93.225,"2013-04-30 16:26:04"
